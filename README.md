 • This project uses Excel, SQL, and Power BI to analyze Kickstarter crowdfunding data and provide insights to improve campaign success. 
   Key   KPIs include project by outcomes, project distribution by location and category,  and success metrics like amount raised, number of backers, and campaign 
   duration.

• 140,313 successful projects raising $1.34 billion, highlighting strong crowdfunding potential. 

• Identified top-performing categories (Comics, Fiction, Fashion) and advised creators to choose categories with higher success rates.

• Noted that high backer engagement and novelty (e.g., Exploding Kittens, Fidget Cube) drive success, recommending creators focus on these   factors.

• Developed a data monitoring system to track live projects and detect early signs of potential suspensions or cancellations.

• Suggested setting realistic goals based on category, backer size, and past project performance to avoid failure.

• Recommended enhanced backer engagement through social media, updates, and transparent communication to maintain trust.

• Designed educational materials to help creators understand trends and avoid common mistakes leading to project failure.
